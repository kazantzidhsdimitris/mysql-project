This is something I've built with mySQL. It's a database with 7 tables and a lot of fake IG users with their likes,photos,hashtags and comments.At the end I've worked with my data so I could answer some real-life questions such as,find the inactive users,find bots or find ghosts accounts etc.

If you want to test my code or just see what I've made you need first to run  the file "Database" ,then the "Tables" ,after that you insert all the fake data with the file "Data" and last but not least you need to run the file "Common questions" where all the questions are stored.

I hope you'll find it interesting!!!
